# INDIVIDUAL PROJECT

Inspired by the idea of UN Sustainable Development Goals number 5 (gender equality) and the Beela Program (I am a mentee!), the idea is to develop the individual project for recommendations and insights with the objective of developing the Beela program.

This project was created for the company Bella and is an analysis of women's data with a focus on foreigners and technology professionals.

The project starts with an overview of women and men in Sweden and aspects of foreign women who are the potential audience for the Beela programme.

The next step is a Google Analytics analysis and a Beela (2021) survey.

At the end, insights to develop the program.
 
 ## In this repository it is possible to analyze only public data. Sensitive data collected from research and Google Analytics has been preserved in a document shared only with Beela
